abstract="We investigate a strategy for reconstructing of buildings from multiple (uncalibrated) images. In a similar manner to the Facade approach we first generate a coarse piecewise planar model of the principal scene planes and their delineations, and then use these facets to guide the search for indentations and protrusions such as windows and doors. However, unlike the Facade approach which involves manual selection and alignment of the geometric primitives, the strategy here is fully automatic.",
